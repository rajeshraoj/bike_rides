## General Information
- This project addresses the business problem of predicting and understanding the demand for shared bikes.
- The background involves a decline in revenues for BoomBikes due to the COVID-19 pandemic, necessitating a data-driven approach to anticipate market demand.
- The dataset includes various features like weather conditions, temperature, humidity, windspeed, and user information, helping us analyze factors impacting bike rental patterns.



## Conclusions
- Temperature and weather conditions significantly influence bike rental demand, with higher rentals observed during favorable weather.
- Year of booking (post-COVID-19) has emerged as a crucial factor, indicating shifting preferences towards personal and outdoor modes of transport.
- Categorical variables such as season, workday, and holidays play a significant role in determining rental patterns.
The model's predictive power, as indicated by an R-squared value of 0.802, suggests a strong ability to predict bike rental demand.
